CelFi Graphing Tool


Step 1) Run all the ncessary all_indel programs and label your samples.  If you have multiple all_indel programs to run, consider using the all_indels_batching tool in the Python>CAGE Programs folder.  *** Make sure guides are labeled like g4 or g400.  Do NOT have spaces between the guide and number.***

Step 2) Enter the CAGE# and NGS run date into the input.csv file in this folder
	* The program will treat each CAGE# separately and has the ability to generate multiple CelFi graphs.  Each project, more accurately each all_indels file, will be it's own separate graph.   

Step 3) Run the program via VS code like usual

Step 4) Follow the prompts to
	* select the number of comparisons (number of bars in the chart)
	* initial and final time points for each comparison

Step 5) Minor adjustments can be made to the graph by utilizing the toolbar above the plot area.  Changes made to the menus will only effect the current graph.
