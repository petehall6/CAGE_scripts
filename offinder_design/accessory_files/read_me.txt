Got NTCs from old file
        NTC_H = r"Z:\ResearchHome\Groups\millergrp\home\common\Screens\All_in_One_Master_library_list\Human\brunello_negative_controls.xlsx"
        NTC_M = r"Z:\ResearchHome\Groups\millergrp\home\common\Screens\All_in_One_Master_library_list\Mouse\negative_controls_ntc.xlsx"

Got NTCs from CRISPick

Combined and ran offinder

Offinder results = guides to remove from combined list
used subtract_df

Cas12 guides were from only CRISPick since 12 is not in the old design
